    <h2>What Are Side-Scrollers?</h2>
    <p>
      Side-scrolling games are a genre of video games where the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle,
      and the game world scrolls horizontally as the player character moves left or right. This perspective creates a 2D
      play environment where characters typically move on a horizontal plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most iconic video games in history are side-scrollers, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
      <li>Sonic the Hedgehog</li>
      <li>Metroid</li>
      <li>Castlevania</li>
      <li>Mega Man</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Side-scrollers can be further categorized into sub-genres like platformers (focused on jumping between platforms),
      run 'n' gun games (focused on combat), and exploration-based games (like Metroidvanias).
    </p>

    <h2>Key Elements of Side-Scrollers</h2>
    <p>
      Side-scrolling games typically include these core elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Character Movement:</strong> Players control a character that moves horizontally (and often vertically
        through jumping)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera System:</strong> The view scrolls to follow the player's movement
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layered Backgrounds:</strong> Multiple background layers that may move at different speeds (parallax
        scrolling)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Platforms and Terrain:</strong> Level design featuring platforms, obstacles, and terrain
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collectibles:</strong> Items that players can gather (coins, power-ups, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enemies:</strong> Obstacles that move or attack the player
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this assignment, we're focusing on the character animation and movement aspects, which form the foundation of
      any side-scrolling game.
    </p>

  <article class="card">
    <h2>Types of Side-Scrollers</h2>
    <p>
      There are several variations of side-scrolling games:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed Screen:</strong> The earliest type where the screen changes only when the player reaches the edge
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Continuous Scrolling:</strong> The screen moves constantly, forcing the player to keep up (like endless
        runners)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Character-Centered:</strong> The screen follows the player character (most common type)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi-Directional:</strong> Allows scrolling in multiple directions (horizontal and vertical)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our project implements a character-centered approach where the character stays relatively fixed on screen while
      the background would scroll (in a more complete implementation).
    </p>

    <h2>Character Movement in Side-Scrollers</h2>
    <p>
      Character movement is the heart of any side-scroller. The typical movement patterns include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Horizontal Movement:</strong> Left and right movement, often with acceleration/deceleration
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jumping:</strong> Vertical movement with gravity and potentially variable jump heights
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>State Changes:</strong> Different animations for different states (idle, running, jumping, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction Facing:</strong> Characters flip to face the direction of movement
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In our project, we're implementing basic horizontal movement and direction facing, with appropriate animation
      states.

    <h2>Implementing Side-Scrolling in Phaser</h2>
    <p>
      There are two main approaches to implementing side-scrolling in Phaser:
    </p>
    <h3>1. Moving the Character (Basic)</h3>
    <p>
      In this approach, the character moves across the screen, but the camera and world stay fixed. This works well for
      games with limited world size or where the action takes place on a single screen.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// Character movement without camera scrolling
update() {
  // Reset velocity
  this.player.setVelocityX(0);

  if (this.cursors.left.isDown) {
    this.player.setVelocityX(-160);
    this.player.setFlipX(true);
    this.player.anims.play('walk', true);
  }
  else if (this.cursors.right.isDown) {
    this.player.setVelocityX(160);
    this.player.setFlipX(false);
    this.player.anims.play('walk', true);
  }
  else {
    this.player.anims.play('idle', true);
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is the approach we're using in our assignment for simplicity.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Moving the Camera (Advanced)</h3>
    <p>
      For larger worlds, you'll want the camera to follow the player. Phaser makes this easy:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// Create a larger world
this.physics.world.bounds.width = 3200;
this.physics.world.bounds.height = 600;

// Make the camera follow the player
this.cameras.main.setBounds(0, 0, 3200, 600);
this.cameras.main.startFollow(this.player);</code></pre>
    <p>
      With this approach, you can create expansive worlds that scroll as the player moves.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Parallax Scrolling</h2>
    <p>
      Parallax scrolling is a technique where background layers move at different speeds, creating an illusion of depth.
      While not part of our basic assignment, it's a common feature in side-scrollers:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// Create background layers (in create())
this.bg1 = this.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 800, 600, 'sky').setOrigin(0, 0);
this.bg2 = this.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 800, 600, 'mountains').setOrigin(0, 0);
this.bg3 = this.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 800, 600, 'ground').setOrigin(0, 0);

// Update the layers each frame (in update())
update() {
  // Update background layers (parallax effect)
  this.bg1.tilePositionX += 0.1;  // Sky moves very slowly
  this.bg2.tilePositionX += 0.3;  // Mountains move a bit faster
  this.bg3.tilePositionX += 0.5;  // Ground moves the fastest

  // Rest of player movement code...
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This creates a beautiful parallax effect where distant objects (like the sky) move more slowly than close objects
      (like the ground).
    </p>

    <h2>Designing Side-Scroller Levels</h2>
    <p>
      Good level design is crucial for side-scrollers. Consider these principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Progression:</strong> Gradually introduce mechanics and increase difficulty
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rhythm:</strong> Create a good rhythm of challenges and breaks
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visual Guides:</strong> Use visual cues to guide players
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verticality:</strong> Utilize both horizontal and vertical space
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Place regular save points or checkpoints
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While our current project doesn't include complex level design, these principles are important for any
      side-scrolling game you might create in the future.

    <h2>Common Side-Scroller Features</h2>
    <p>
      To expand your side-scroller beyond this basic assignment, consider adding these common features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Jumping and Platforms:</strong> Add vertical movement and platforms to traverse
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collectibles:</strong> Items to gather for points or power-ups
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enemies:</strong> Obstacles that require skill to overcome
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Double jumps, dashes, or other special moves
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Spikes, pits, or other dangers
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scrolling Backgrounds:</strong> Parallax effects for depth
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As you master the basics of character animation and movement, these additional features can make your game more
      engaging and complete.
