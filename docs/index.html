    <h2>Introduction to Character Animation</h2>
    <p>
      Creating engaging, animated characters is a fundamental aspect of game development. In this
      project, you'll learn how to implement character animation and movement using sprite sheets
      in Phaser 3, a powerful JavaScript game framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike our previous "Hello Phaser" project which focused on basic interaction, this assignment
      takes you deeper into game development by introducing sprite-based animation - the technique used
      in countless 2D games to bring characters to life.

    <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
    <p>By completing this assignment, you'll learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Load and work with sprite sheets in Phaser 3</li>
      <li>Create frame-by-frame animations from sprite sheets</li>
      <li>Implement character movement with keyboard controls</li>
      <li>Flip sprites to change their facing direction</li>
      <li>Change animations based on character state (idle vs. walking)</li>
      <li>Implement simple collision detection with screen boundaries</li>
      <li>Create a multi-scene game with title and game over screens</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Features</h2>
    <p>
      This project is structured as a side-scrolling character demo with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Animated Character:</strong> A character that walks left and right with frame-by-frame animation</li>
      <li><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong> Arrow keys to move the character</li>
      <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Different animations based on whether the character is moving or idle</li>
      <li><strong>Scene Transitions:</strong> Title screen, gameplay, and game over screens</li>
      <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Character stops at screen edges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Character Animation Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Character animation is more than just visual appeal - it provides crucial feedback to players about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current state of their character (idle, walking, jumping)</li>
      <li>The direction they're facing</li>
      <li>Whether their inputs are being registered</li>
      <li>The personality and feel of the game world</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These animation skills form the foundation for creating more complex games with responsive,
      engaging characters that players can connect with.
